            | Walked past with my partner and decided we wanted a massage. They fit us in no worries right away and put us in a room together for a couples massage. 
            | It smelt nice inside, the music was calming and the massage was wonderful. The bonus was that it\'s wasn\'t too expensive 
            | and we could claim it back from health insurance at the end. Would definitely recommend this place.

            | Me and my boyfriend visited for the first time. I wasnâ€™t expected much as it in tourist center. 
            | But we were so impressed of how much effort they gave to the massage. 
            | Pressure was on point and hit all the spots. Truly professional authentic Thai massage. 
            | Highly recommend this place.
